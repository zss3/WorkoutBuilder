        <p>
          Zack believes in working out with an intense "no pain,
          no gain" mindset. Though he stands behind the importance of
          working the full body, he was given the
          nickname <span style="color: #5e62d1; font-weight: bold">"The Arms Assassin"</span> when he started working his biceps
          in the fourth grade. If you need a trainer who will hold you
          accountable and push you to your limits,
          Zack would be a great choice.

        <p> "Mamba Mentality, A constant quest to be the best version of yourself". As a trainer that is all I ask, yes it will be hard, no you can not take a break, and yes you will get great results. Come to the gym to see friends, hang out, and take selfies? Sorry not the trainer for you (selfies are for post workout to admire gains).
          You can not out work a bad diet (I've tried!) when choosing myself as your trainer not only do you get the intensity of a former D1 athlete you also recieve the nutritional guidance to upgrade to you 2.0! Known around these parts as <span style="color: #5e62d1; font-weight: bold">"The Back Behemoth"</span>, you'll find out why  </p>
